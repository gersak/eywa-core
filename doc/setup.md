### Prerequisites
 * Java - Probably you already have java installed but if not, supported versions are 8,11,17. To install check your favorite package manager. Brew, Nix, Chocolatey, Scoop, etc.
 * Clojure - check out official [installation guide](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)
 * [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - Download [executable](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/releases) for you Distribution.
                                   Place it on PATH (copy it to 'System32' or '/usr/bin' if you don't care).
 * Your favorite text editor. Best user experiance developing Clojure(script) is with (Neo)Vim, Emacs, VSCode, IntelliJ


#### Neovim
I use [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) and I would recommend it every time. Also there is [Fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace) made by legend so you can't  miss with either...


#### Emacs
Help... Please point out some good setup documentation. Anyway if u use Emacs you are **more than capable** to find a way to setup Clojure environment


#### VSCode
Strongly suggested to use [Calva](https://calva.io)


#### IntelliJ
Check out [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com)
